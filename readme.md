This is a calulator that will compute the number of possible number of combinations when choosing a sample from a group or population of data.

equation:
n!/k!(n-k)!
where

n = the population size

k = the size of the sample you are selecting


for example say you have 5 letters (a, b, c, d, e), and you were going to randomly select 2 of them. there are 10 different possible combinations that you will get when the order they are selected doesn't matter.

the 10 possible combinations would be:
  
  a and b,
  
  a and c,
  
  a and d,
  
  a and e,
  
  b and c,
  
  b and d,
  
  b and e,
  
  c and d,
  
  c and e,
  
  d and e
